Embedded Sensors Lab Projects – IMTEK, University of Freiburg

This repository contains reports and analysis from a hands-on Sensors Laboratory Course conducted at the Laboratory for Electrical Instrumentation and Embedded Systems at IMTEK. 
The experiments were performed using the Arduino Nicla Sense ME development board, integrating multiple state-of-the-art MEMS sensors. 
The goal was to understand sensor behavior, perform real-time data acquisition and apply scientific methods for evaluating measurement accuracy and environmental influences.

Modules Overview: 
Module 1 – Pressure and Acceleration Sensors
Sensors Used: BMP390 (barometric pressure), BHI260AP (accelerometer)
Module 2 – Magnetic Field Measurement
Sensor Used: BMM150 (3-axis magnetometer)
Module 3 – Gas and Air Quality Monitoring
Sensor Used: BME688 (VOC, temperature, humidity, pressure)

Skills Gained: 
Real-time sensor data acquisition using Arduino Nicla Sense ME.
Serial data logging and filtering with Python.
Environmental parameter estimation and cross-sensor validation.
Data visualization and interpretation based on physical principles.
Critical assessment of sensor drift, resolution and calibration needs.
